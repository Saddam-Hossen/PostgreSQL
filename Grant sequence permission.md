Thanks ‚Äî you're successfully connected as `evan`, but still getting:

```
ERROR: permission denied for sequence users_id_seq
```

That confirms `evan` has permission to insert into the `users` table but **not to use the sequence** that auto-generates the `id`.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Fix: Grant sequence permission

Log back in as **postgres**:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d mydb
```

Then run:

```sql
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE users_id_seq TO evan;
```

‚úÖ This will let `evan` use the `id` auto-increment mechanism.

---

## üîÅ Optional: For all sequences in `public` schema

If you want to future-proof access for `evan`, run:

```sql
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO evan;

ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO evan;
```

---

## ‚úÖ After That

Log back in as `evan` and try again:

```sql
INSERT INTO users(name, email) VALUES ('Test User', 'test@example.com');
```

üéâ This should now insert successfully.

---

Let me know if you'd like a full `.sql` script that sets up:

* a user
* access to a specific DB
* table + sequence permissions
* future-proof default privileges
