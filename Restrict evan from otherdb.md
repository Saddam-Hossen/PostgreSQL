Thanks ‚Äî you've hit on two **very important but different behaviors** in PostgreSQL:

---

## üßµ Let‚Äôs address both issues clearly:

---

## ‚úÖ ISSUE 1: **Spring Boot can't connect as `evan`**

### üîç Problem:

You said:

> ‚Äú`evan` cannot connect from Spring Boot to database.‚Äù

### üîé Most common causes:

1. **Wrong database URL or username/password**
2. `evan` does not have `CONNECT` privilege on the target DB
3. Spring Boot's `application.properties` is pointing to the wrong database
4. PostgreSQL host is rejecting the connection (due to `pg_hba.conf`)

---

### ‚úÖ Fix checklist:

1. **In `application.properties`:**

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
   spring.datasource.username=evan
   spring.datasource.password=evan123
   ```

2. In PostgreSQL:

   ```sql
   GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO evan;
   ```

3. Optional:
   In `pg_hba.conf`, ensure a rule exists like:

   ```
   host    mydb    evan    127.0.0.1/32    md5
   ```

4. Restart PostgreSQL after editing `pg_hba.conf`:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql restart  # Linux
   ```

## ‚úÖ ISSUE 2: **In pgAdmin, `evan` can create tables in other databases**

> Even though you didn't give permission to `evan` on `otherdb`, he can still create tables?

That‚Äôs a **permissions issue**. Here's what likely happened:

---

### üîé By default:

* PostgreSQL gives **`USAGE` on `public` schema** to all users in new databases.
* If `evan` can connect to `otherdb`, and the `public` schema has not been locked down, he can create tables.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix: Restrict `evan` from `otherdb`

Run this **as `postgres` or superuser**:

```sql
-- Revoke connection from evan
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE otherdb FROM evan;

-- Optional: make sure public schema in otherdb is protected
\c otherdb

REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

---

## üîê Best Practice Setup for `evan`

To make sure `evan`:

‚úÖ Can only access `mydb`
‚ùå Cannot even connect to or create anything in other DBs

Run this:

```sql
-- Connect as postgres
-- Revoke from all databases except mydb
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres FROM evan;
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE template1 FROM evan;
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE otherdb FROM evan;

-- Grant only mydb
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO evan;

-- Revoke global access to public schema in all DBs
\c postgres
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;

\c template1
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;

\c otherdb
REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

## ‚úÖ Summary

| What                               | Fix                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Evan can't connect via Spring Boot | Check DB URL, password, and `GRANT CONNECT`       |
| Evan can create tables in other DB | Revoke connect + schema privileges from those DBs |
